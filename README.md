Project: Case 1_Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel

General Description: 
•	The project is to find all possible paths, the shortest path, the lowest cost path and the longest path that a marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, and goes through three other cities: Hemet, Moreno Valley, and Perris, then goes back to home Riverside. 
•	The project uses STL-vectors and structures to define the edges and paths. It also uses sort to sort the order of city names, and permute and combine each route.
•	In the project, there are four choices to choose which paths the specialist wants to find, choice 1 is to give the specialist all the paths that can be used wouthout repeating any noted cities; choice 2 is to calculate the shortest path; choice 3 is to calculate the lowest cost path; choice 4 is to calcuate the longest path that the specialist might need to void. 
•	The limitation of this project is that it can’t calculate the long paths when the user may need to repeat some cities.
•	The projects can use other STL containers to shorten and simplify the codes when I use the for loop and if statements to get the total distance for each path.
